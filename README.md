# Openbox-config
My Openbox configs and other stuff which fits into a common style.

This is personal Openbox window manager configuration files, plus other useful stuff.

In .scripts directory you will find various files - wrapper scripts and little toys for terminal fun :)

Beside installing Openbox, you also need to install some essential supporting packages: `suckless-tools hsetroot xsettingsd lxappearance scrot conky lemonbar openbox-menu lxmenu-data arc-theme geany mpd mpc ncmpcpp rxvt-unicode-256color`

For keybinds just read the ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml file
